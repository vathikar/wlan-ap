No TIP specific extensions are used.


# Building wlan-ap-consumer

The basic procedure is the same as described in the root [README.md](../../README.md)

To generate the .config file, use the following command:
```
cd openwrt
./scripts/gen_config.py ea8300 wlan-ap-consumer wifi-ath
```

If you want to build SR400ac, you should use:
```
cd openwrt
./scripts/gen_config.py sr400ac wlan-ap-consumer wifi-bcm
```

Immediately after this step, apply patches found in `feeds/wlan-ap-consumer/additional-patches`:
```
cd ..
./feeds/wlan-ap-consumer/additional-patches/apply-patches.sh
```

To connect to Plume Cloud, a tar package is required (developers can obtain it from Plume).

Untar the the package to `wlan-ap/feeds/wlan-ap-consumer/opensync/src/service-provider`:
```
tar -xzvf ~/Downloads/service-provider_opensync-dev.tgz -C feeds/wlan-ap-consumer/opensync/src/service-provider
```

An `opensync-dev` sub-directory should appear inside the service-provider directory.
